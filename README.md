# Welcome! ðŸš€

ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm Devin, a seasoned Full Stack & AI Systems Integrator based in Austin, TX with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry. I craft digital magic with Python, React, Node.js, APIs, MongoDB, and SQL. 

ðŸ‘€ Specializing in business based applications, data & cloud migrations, and complex problem-solving. I love making streamlined systems work to enhance human operations while minimizing the downsides of losing the human touch.

ðŸŒ± Alongside everyone else, I'm racing to learn the best and most effective ways to utilize AI. I recently read "The Coming Wave" by Mustafa Suleyman and am inspired to be on the right side of generative AI.

ðŸ’¼ If you value experience, dependability, strong communication, and timely deliverables, let's collaborate! Here's what I bring to the table:
- End-to-End Full Stack Development
- Database Design and Management
- Scalable Web Application Engineering
- API Development and Integration
- AI-Powered Solutions
- Responsive Website Redesign
- Real-Time Application Development
- Performance Optimization
- Server Management and Deployment

ðŸ’¡ I'm not just able to write code; I'm an entrepreneur at heart and a techie by trade. I thrive under pressure, love the hardest challenges in tech, and my tech arsenal is Apple dominated.

âš¡ Fun fact: I've traveled all lower 48 states in an RV, play rap songs on piano, and have read over 300 books.
