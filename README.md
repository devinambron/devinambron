# Welcome! ðŸš€

ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm Devin, a Business Applications Builder based in Austin, TX, with over 15 years of experience crafting streamlined digital solutions for businesses. I create applications that optimize operations and solve complex problems using Python, React, Node.js, APIs, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, and SQL.

ðŸ‘€ My focus is on building scalable business applications, handling data migrations, and engineering web apps that enhance human operations while keeping the personal touch intact.

ðŸŒ± On the side, Iâ€™m exploring AI technologies and how they can complement modern web and business applications. I recently read "The Coming Wave" by Mustafa Suleyman and enjoy keeping up with the latest in AI as a hobbyist.

ðŸ’¼ What I bring to the table:
- Full Stack Development
- Database Design and Management
- Scalable Web Application Engineering
- API Development and Integration
- Performance Optimization
- Server Management and Deployment
- Real-Time Application Development

ðŸ’¡ I'm an entrepreneur at heart, always excited to take on new challenges and build systems that work.

âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™ve traveled to all lower 48 states in an RV, play rap songs on the piano, and have read over 300 books.
